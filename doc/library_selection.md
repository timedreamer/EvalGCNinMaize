# Library Selection Logic

1. In total **1304** libraries were downloaded and alligned to the genome.

2. Within **1304** libraries, **11** libraries with allignment rate less than 70%
were excluded from following analysis (See Table1).

3. The rest of **1293** samples, **26** of them contain less than 5 million reads
were also excluded(See Table2).

4. As result, **1267** libraries were left. However, for some reason I did not
include _SRR3351629_ which is a good sample. So after all, **1266** sammples were
used for the following analysis.
> Probably just say: didn't inlcude _SRR3351629_ at the beginning. I don't think
it will change the result I got.
