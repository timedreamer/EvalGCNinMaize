# Maize Gene Co-expression Network Project Overview

The aim of this project is to build maize GCN using several different methods and test which methods is the best from RNA-Seq data.

1.  Choose publicly available RNA-Seq libraries in SRA.
2.  Download SRA files from NCBI using wget command.
3.  Convert .sra files into .fastq files using fastq-dump from SRA toolkit
4.  Cut adapters using Cutadapt. Since all libraries are from standard illumina sequencing, so the same adapter sequence were applied here (AGATCGGAAGAGC). Taken from Trim Galore manual.
5. The processed fastq files were quality checked with FASTQC.
6. HISAT2 was used in the allignment step to get bam files. Then gene counts were calculated from bam files using Feature Count.
7. Also, allignment-free kallisto was used to get transcript level expression. But I don't think I will use that data.
> Above steps were done by  pauper serve or KIN2077 XUbuntu machine. In order to streamline all above steps, *_snakemake_* workflow management was used here.
